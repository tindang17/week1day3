Repl - Read Evaluate Print Loop

Every expression in js has both a value and a type
  - example: "2" has a value of 2 and a numeric type

Atatement is a line of JS code can be made up of many expression

There is a trend in JS not to use null

A major difference between primitives and objects is that objects are 'mutable' and primitives are 'immutable'

Function side-effects:
- any mutation of the objects
Primitive values:
// String
// String literal expression are stuff inside quotes
var aString = 'I\'m in a quote'

//Numbers
// Number literal expression are stuff inside quotes
 var aNumber = 3442

//Boolean

var trueLiteral = true
var falseLiteral = false

// Undefined
var undefinedLiteral = undefined

//Null
var nullLiteral = null

//...

//Object
//Object literal syntax
var literalObject = {}
// Array Literal Syntax
var arrayLiteral = [];

var 0 = {
  . name:
}
